# 🏠 Classes and Objects in Java

This folder contains Java programming files that demonstrate the fundamental concepts of classes and objects. These concepts are the backbone of object-oriented programming (OOP) and provide the foundation for creating reusable and modular code.

## 📂 Files Included:

1. **🔑 Access Modifiers**

   - Demonstrates the use of different access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, `default`) to control the visibility and access level of class members.

2. **💼 Class Structure**

   - Illustrates the basic structure of a class, including fields, methods, constructors, and access modifiers. This file provides a clear example of how a class is defined in Java.

3. **🖊 Object Creation**

   - Shows how to create objects from a class, initializing them with values and calling their methods to perform actions.

4. **🔀 Assigning Objects**

   - Explains how objects can be assigned to other objects and how this operation affects the reference to the object in memory.

5. **🔐 Final Class and Methods**

   - Demonstrates the use of the `final` keyword to declare classes and methods that cannot be extended or overridden. It ensures the immutability of the class or method.

6. **🏠 Nested Classes**

   - Covers the concept of nested classes, explaining how one class can be defined within another. This file demonstrates the use of inner classes and static nested classes.

7. **💬 Passing Arguments by Value and Reference**

   - Explains the distinction between passing arguments by value and by reference in Java, showing how primitive data types and objects behave differently when passed to methods.

8. **🎯 Accessing Private Members**

   - Illustrates how private members of a class can be accessed and modified using getter and setter methods, ensuring proper encapsulation and control over object data.

This folder will help you understand how to work with classes, create objects, manipulate object data, and use Java's OOP features effectively.
