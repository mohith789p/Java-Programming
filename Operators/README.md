## 📂 Files Included:

1. **🔀 Precedence and Associativity**

   - Explains the precedence and associativity rules for Java operators, helping to determine the order of operations in expressions.

2. **📝 Assignment Operators**

   - Demonstrates how assignment operators are used to assign values to variables and includes examples of compound assignment operators.

3. **➕ Arithmetic Operators**

   - Covers the use of arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

4. **📈 Increment and Decrement**

   - Explains the usage of increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators in both pre and post forms.

5. **❓ Ternary Operator**

   - Demonstrates the ternary operator (`? :`), a concise way to perform conditional operations.

6. **⚖️ Relational Operators**

   - Explains relational operators used for comparison, such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

7. **🔗 Logical Operators**

   - Covers logical operators like `&&`, `||`, and `!`, which are used to perform logical operations on boolean values.

8. **💡 Bitwise Operators**
   - Demonstrates the use of bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`) for bit-level operations.
