   - This file demonstrates how to handle command-line arguments in Java, allowing programs to accept input from the command line during execution.

2. **🔢 Data Types**

   - Learn about the different data types in Java, such as primitive and reference types, and their usage.

3. **🔑 Escape Sequence**

   - Understand how escape sequences work in Java to represent special characters within strings.

4. **🔒 Final Keyword**

   - Explore the `final` keyword in Java, which can be used to define constants, prevent inheritance, and prevent method overriding.

5. **🎨 Formatted Output**

8. **⚙️ Static Keyword**

   - Learn about the `static` keyword and how it is used for class-level variables and methods.

9. **📏 Symbolic Constants**

   - Explore the concept of symbolic constants, which are typically defined using `final` and `static` for values that do not change.

10. **🔄 Type Casting**

    - An overview of type casting in Java, which allows conversion between different data types.

11. **🖋️ User Input**

    - Learn how to accept user input in Java using classes like `Scanner` to interact with the user.
