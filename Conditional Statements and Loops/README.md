# 🔄 Conditional Statements and Loops in Java

This folder contains Java programming files that illustrate the use of conditional statements and loops. These constructs are essential for controlling the flow of a program and executing code based on specific conditions or repeatedly.

## 📂 Files Included:

1. **🔑 Break Keyword**

   - Demonstrates how the `break` keyword is used to terminate loops or switch statements prematurely.

2. **🔄 Continue Keyword**

   - Explains the use of the `continue` keyword to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed with the next iteration.

3. **🔁 DoWhile Keyword**

   - Shows the usage of the `do-while` loop, where the condition is checked after the loop's body is executed.

4. **🌀 ForEach**

   - Covers the `for-each` loop, a simplified loop for iterating over collections and arrays.

5. **🔂 For Loop**

   - Demonstrates the `for` loop, which allows repeated execution of a block of code with an iteration control mechanism.

6. **❓ If Else**

   - Explains the `if-else` construct, used for decision-making by executing different blocks of code based on conditions.

7. **🔑 If Keyword**

   - Introduces the basic `if` statement for conditional execution of a code block.

8. **🔗 Nested For Loop**

   - Shows how to use `for` loops inside another `for` loop to handle complex iterations.

9. **🔀 Nested If**

   - Demonstrates the use of `if` statements inside another `if` to create multi-level decision structures.

10. **🔀 Switch Keyword**

    - Explains the `switch` statement, a multi-way branch statement for choosing among multiple options.

11. **❓ Ternary Operator**

    - Covers the ternary operator (`? :`), a compact alternative to `if-else` for conditional expressions.

12. **🔄 While Keyword**
    - Explains the `while` loop, which repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to `true`.
